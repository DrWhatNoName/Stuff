<h1>Password Bolt - User Manual and Technical Details</h1>
<h2>7. Random password generator</h2>
<h3>7.1 Basic Operation</h3>
The random password generator is provided on the registration page and the passwords page. It provides very high quality random data that can be used for passwords. The random passwords will never be generated twice, they are yours and yours only. It is a good idea to use these types of passwords for everything. Use ASCII whenever possible, alpha-numeric is provided for services that do not allow special characters in passwords. HEX can be used for encryption keys, such as for WPA2 wireless encryption. 
<h3>7.2 Technical Details</h3>
This system is a PHP CSPRNG (similar to the one created by Steve Gibson of Gibson Research Corporation, found at <a href="http://grc.com/passwords" style="text-decoration:underline">http://grc.com/passwords</a>. Stored in the database are two values, the IV and the counter. First, they are pulled from the database. The counter is incremented, then the counter, IV, and the result of an mt_rand() call are then hashed togeather with ServerHash. This provides 256 bits of random data. The random data is inserted into the database as the IV, and the counter is incremented. The algorithm is run once more before the database is updated, so that the random data that is generated by the function isn't put into the database.<br /><br />

mt_rand() is used to add a tiny bit more randomness to the system. There may be a risk that after hundreds of terrabytes of data from mt_rand() are added to the system (compared to the 256 bit original seed) that the system would become predictable. This would not be a weakness of the RNG but of the underlying hash algorithms.<br /><br />

The random data from this can be used to generate passwords for users to use. To do this, 64 bytes of random data are continually divided by the length of the character set, the remainder being the index of the character in the character set.
