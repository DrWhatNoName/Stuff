<h1>Password Bolt - User Manual and Technical Details</h1>
<h2>11. Deleting the account</h2>
<h3>11.1 Basic Operation</h3>
<h4>11.1.1 Deleting the passwords for an account</h4>
To delete all of the passwords for an account, click 'Settings' in the navbar, then click 'Delete Passwords'. Enter the login information for the password list that you wish to delete in the 'Confirm Delete Passwords' section. Click 'DELETE PASSWORDS' to finish the operation. Doing this will ONLY delete the passwords in the list for the password and keyfile that you provide. Any other accounts, such as hidden accounts will remain untouched. You can provide any password and keyfile here to delete any one of your password lists without having to log out and log back in.
<h4>11.1.2 Deleting the entire account</h4>
To delete the entire account, click 'Settings' in the navbar, then click 'Delete Account'. Enter the deletion key that you were given when you created your account and click 'DELETE ACCOUNT' to complete the operation. This will only delete the user account entry in the database - not the passwords - meaning that your passwords remain in the database but will not be accessible even with your login information, so don't worry. The passwords are not deleted to provide plausible deniability to other users. Read the 'Deleting the passwords for an account' section to understand how to actually delete the passwords.
<h3>11.2 Technical Details</h3>
When the passwords are deleted, they are simply removed from the database. When the account is deleted, the user's row in the database is removed. This deletes the salt  used to create the encryption key, so even with the user's login information it is impossible to decrypt the passwords. The unusable ciphertexts are left in the database to provide another excuse for ciphertexts being present in the database.
