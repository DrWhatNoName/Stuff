<h1>Password Bolt - User Manual and Technical Details</h1>
<h2>2. Logging in</h2>
<h3>2.1 Basic Operation</h3>
To login to your account, visit the Password Bolt homepage. You will be asked for a username, password and keyfile. Enter the username you registered, then you may enter any password to login. For each different password you enter when you login, you will be brought to a seperate storage area for your passwords. You can have one password for sensitive data, and one password to take you to a fake list of passwords so if anyone forces you to give up your passwords, give them the password for the fake account. Even with full access to the database, it is impossible to prove that an account is fake.
<br /><br />
Optionally, you may use keyfiles to provide stronger authentication to your account. Keyfiles can be any file, although it is reccomended that you get one from the random keyfile generator by clicking 'Download random keyfile'. Using a keyfile provides stronger authentication because to login, you need something you know (your password), and something you have (the keyfile). Authentication can be made even stronger by using one time passwords.
<br /><br />
If you have one time password authentication set up for your account, you will be asked for the next password in the series to login. It is important to note that the one time password system does not provide stronger encryption for your data, only stronger authentication in the case where the attacker does not have physical access to the server.
To setup one time passwords, go to your account settings and follow the link to the one time password setup page. Use a very strong password for the master key and keep it somewhere physically safe. I would reccomend using a password from the password generator, printing it off, and storing it in a safe deposit box.
<h3>2.2 Technical Details</h3>
When the user logs in, their login information is used to generate the encryption key and the authentication token (deprecated from when password bolt authenticated the password to the account). The key is generated by hashing it with salt using the UserKey function. The user's IP address is hashed along with salt and their encryption key (so the 2^32 IP addresses can't be brute forced). A random encryption key is generated for encrypting the cookies which contain the encryption key and the authentication token. The cookie encryption key is changed on every page load to reduce the risk of (not prevent) a cookie stealing attack. The user's time the user wishes his session to expire is encrypted with their encryption key and stored in the database so that after that time has passed the user will be logged out.
<br /><br />
The one time password system is similar to S/KEY. The master password is hashed with salt, and the result of that is hashed over and over again. The hashes are used to generate the one time passwords. The system proves that the client is who they say they are by checking that the one time password they provide hashes into the one time password from the last time they logged in. The one time password  is stored in an encrypted cookie on the user's computer. If the server can decrypt the cookie and check that it is the same as the last one time password, it proves that they passed the one time password authentication stage.
