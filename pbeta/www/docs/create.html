<h1>Password Bolt - User Manual and Technical Details</h1>
<h2>1. Creating an account</h2>
<h3>1.1 Basic Operation</h3>
To create an account, click the register link in the navbar. You will be asked for a username and an email address. The email address is optional, it will only be used to notify you of any security breaches which will include a full disclosure of the attack. You do not provide a password when creating an account because Password Bolt lets you login with any password, and each password you use to login brings you to a seperate storage area for your passwords.
<br /><br />
When you create your account, you will be provided with a 256 bit key. This key protects your account from being deleted by someone else. You will need to provide it when you delete your account.
<h3>1.2 Technical Details</h3>
When the user account is created, the name and email are added to the database. New, random salt is generated for generating the encryption key and hashing the IP address. The deletion key is hashed with salt using the ServerHash function and stored in the database, so it can be checked when the user wants to delete their account.
