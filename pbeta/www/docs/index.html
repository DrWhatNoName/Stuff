<h3>0.1 Description</h3>
Password Bolt is a web based password manager written in PHP. It's goal is to provide a safe place to store passwords and other data. It also provides plausible deniability to help out in circumstances where the user is being forced to reveal their passwords. Password Bolt uses only the strongest and proven cryptographic techniques to protect the user's data, allowing it to protect everything from simple website passwords to highly sensitive data. Password Bolt is completely open source, which allows anyone to use it and make modifications freely. It also encourages peer review so that over time, Password Bolt can be proven to be secure.
<h3>0.2 User Manual Layout</h3>

The second level, 'Technical Details', dives deeper into the operation of Password Bolt so that you know how your data is being protected. Peer review is very important for security, the more people that review the code, the more secure it becomes. For those of you with PHP knowledge, it is a good idea to download the source code and review it while reading the technical details. Please forward any mistakes you find to firexware@hotmail.com
