	Password Bolt is secure as long as three conditions are met. The server has not been compromised, the client's computer has not been compromised, and the connection between the client and server is secure. If all of those conditions are met, Password Bolt's security comes directly from the strength of the user's password and keyfile.
	<br /><br />
	- Read the user manual and understand how Pasword Bolt works. <br />
	- <b>NEVER use Password Bolt on a computer that may have viruses.</b><br />
	- <b>NEVER use Password Bolt from a public computer.</b> (ie. hotel lobby)<br />
	- ALWAYS connect using SSL.<br />
	- Take the time to memorize a very strong password.<br />
	- Use a keyfile.<br />
	- For optimal security, host password bolt on your own computer.<br />
